# AirBnB Clone Project


 Project Description

In this first section of the AirBnB clone project, we are to work on the backend while integrating it with a console application using Python's cmd module.
The created data (python objects) is stored in a json file and can be accessed using the json module in Python. 

 Description of the Command Interpreter

The application's user interface is quite similar to the Bash shell, 
with the exception that it only accepts a small set of commands that were specifically created for use with the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

. show

. create

. update

. destroy

. count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the following actions can be performed:

. Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)

. Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc...

. Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)

. Updating attributes of an object

. Destroying an object

 How to start it

With the help of these steps, you can get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distribution) for development and testing purposes.
