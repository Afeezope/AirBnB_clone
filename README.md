# AirBnB Clone Project


 Project Description

In this first section of the AirBnB clone project, we are to work on the backend while integrating it with a console application using Python's cmd module.
The created data (python objects) is stored in a json file and can be accessed using the json module in Python. 

 Description of the Command Interpreter

The application's user interface is quite similar to the Bash shell, 
with the exception that it only accepts a small set of commands that were specifically created for use with the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.
